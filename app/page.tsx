          The Consortium began in 1993 as a “grass roots” organization and later became a committee of the Sacramento
          Historical Society. It serves as a forum for organizations interested in local history to meet, share, and
          exchange thoughts and ideas. Now independent from the Historical Society, the Consortium operates as a
          free-standing organization. Its mission remains to promote and amplify the efforts of our individual
          Societies and Organizations and, in doing so, create a stronger representation for our history through
          communication, publicity, linkage, and mutual support.
