## To implement a Request Access Approval System in a Supabase + Next.js 15 project, where all routes except those in a `protected` folder are public, and CRUD access is gated by manager approval, follow these steps:

## 1. **Project Setup**

- **Create a new Next.js 15 project** and install Supabase dependencies:
  ```
  npx create-next-app@latest your-app
  npm install @supabase/supabase-js
  ```
- **Set up environment variables** with your Supabase project URL and anon key in `.env.local`[7].

## 2. **Supabase Auth: Signup, Email Verification, Login**

- Use Supabase’s built-in email/password auth for signup and login.
- Implement the signup and login forms as shown in Supabase’s Next.js example:

  - Create a `login` folder with a `page.jsx` containing the form.
  - Use server actions to call `supabase.auth.signUp` and `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`[1][4][5].

- On signup, users receive a verification email. After verifying, they can log in, but you’ll restrict their permissions until approved.

## 3. **User Roles and Approval Flow**

- **Create a `profiles` table** in Supabase linked to `auth.users` (user_id as PK).
- Add a `role` (e.g., `pending`, `approved`, `manager`) and an `approved` boolean column to the `profiles` table[3].
- On signup, insert a new profile with `role: 'pending'` and `approved: false`.

## 4. **Manager Approval System**

- Build a manager dashboard route (e.g., `/manager/requests`) listing users with `approved: false`.
- Allow managers to approve users by updating their profile’s `approved` field to `true` and `role` to `approved`.

## 5. **Route Protection in Next.js 15**

- Place protected routes inside the `/protected` folder.
- Use Next.js middleware or server-side logic to:
  - Check if the user is authenticated.
  - Fetch the user’s profile from Supabase.
  - Allow access only if `approved: true` and/or `role: 'approved'` or `manager`[3][4].

**Example Middleware Logic:**

```javascript
// middleware.js
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js"

export async function middleware(req) {
  // Get user session (use cookies or Supabase helpers)
  // Fetch user profile from Supabase
  // If not approved, redirect to an access request/pending page
}
```

## 6. **CRUD Permissions via Row Level Security (RLS)**

- Enable RLS on your data tables in Supabase.
- Write policies to allow CRUD only for users with `approved: true` or `role: 'approved'`/`manager`.

**Example Policy:**

```sql
-- Allow only approved users to perform CRUD
CREATE POLICY "Allow approved users"
ON your_table
FOR ALL
USING (EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE profiles.user_id = auth.uid() AND profiles.approved = true
));
```

## 7. **Summary of Steps**

- Set up Supabase and Next.js 15 project[1][4][7].
- Implement signup/login with email verification.
- Create a `profiles` table with `approved` and `role` fields.
- Default new users to `approved: false`.
- Managers approve users via a dashboard.
- Protect `/protected` routes using middleware and server checks.
- Enforce CRUD permissions with RLS policies.

This structure ensures only manager-approved users can access protected CRUD operations, while public routes remain open to all.
